# Comparative-Analysis-of-twitter-data-using-ngram-models
This project contains my final Natural Language Processing project which is comparative analysis of twitter data using ngram (Unigram, bigram and trigram) models


The steps that I plan to follow are as following:
STEP 1: Obtain the data from twitter. 
STEP 2: Cleaning of the data.
---> Removal of hashtags
---> Taking care of stop words, colloquilisms, slang words, abbreviations.
STEP 3: Applying the ngram models and getting the desired output.
